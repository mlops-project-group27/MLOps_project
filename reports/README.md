# Exam template for 02476 Machine Learning Operations

This is the report template for the exam. Please only remove the text formatted as with three dashes in front and behind
like:

```--- question 1 fill here ---```

Where you instead should add your answers. Any other changes may have unwanted consequences when your report is
auto-generated at the end of the course. For questions where you are asked to include images, start by adding the image
to the `figures` subfolder (please only use `.png`, `.jpg` or `.jpeg`) and then add the following code in your answer:

`![my_image](figures/<image>.<extension>)`

In addition to this markdown file, we also provide the `report.py` script that provides two utility functions:

Running:

```bash
python report.py html
```

Will generate a `.html` page of your report. After the deadline for answering this template, we will auto-scrape
everything in this `reports` folder and then use this utility to generate a `.html` page that will be your serve
as your final hand-in.

Running

```bash
python report.py check
```

Will check your answers in this template against the constraints listed for each question e.g. is your answer too
short, too long, or have you included an image when asked. For both functions to work you mustn't rename anything.
The script has two dependencies that can be installed with

```bash
pip install typer markdown
```

or

```bash
uv add typer markdown
```

## Overall project checklist

> **which did you use and how did they help you complete the project?**
>
> Recommended answer length: 0-200 words.
>
> Example:
> *We used the third-party framework ... in our project. We used functionality ... and functionality ... from the*
> *package to do ... and ... in our project*.
>
> Answer:

We used **EvidentlyAI** to perform data drift detection by comparing reference data collected during training with data observed at inference time.

For configuration management, we used **Hydra**, which simplified experiment configuration and enabled clean seperation between code and hyperparametrs.

We also used **Typer** to implement command-line interfaces for training and evaluation scripts, providing a consistent and user-freindly way to run
project components.

Finnaly, we used **Weights & Bias** for experiment tracking, enabling logging of training metrics, configuration parameters, and model artifacts, which
supported systematic experimentation and comparison across runs.

## Coding environment

> In the following section we are interested in learning more about you local development environment. This includes
> how you managed dependencies, the structure of your code and how you managed code quality.

### Question 4

> **Explain how you managed dependencies in your project? Explain the process a new team member would have to go**
> **through to get an exact copy of your environment.**
>
> Recommended answer length: 100-200 words
>
> Example:
> *We used ... for managing our dependencies. The list of dependencies was auto-generated using ... . To get a*
> *complete copy of our development environment, one would have to run the following commands*
>
> Answer:

We managed project dependencies using a combination of `pyproject.toml` and the `uv` package manager, which allowed us to maintain a reproducible
and well-defined Python environment. All direct dependencies are declared in `pyproject.toml`, while exact, resolved versions are pinned in the
automatically generated `uv.lock` file.

For local development, a new team memmber ca recreate the environment by first installing `uv` and then running `uv sync`, which installs all
dependencies exaclty as specified in the lock file. Development-specific dependecies, such as testing and linitng tools, are included in a seperate
dependency group to keep the runtime environment minimal.

Dependencies are als reprorudef in containerized environments. The Dockerfiles used for training and inference install dependencies directly from the
same dependency specifications, ensuring consistency between local development, continuous integration, and deployment.

### Question 5

> **We expect that you initialized your project using the cookiecutter template. Explain the overall structure of your**
> **code. What did you fill out? Did you deviate from the template in some way?**
>
> Recommended answer length: 100-200 words
>
> Example:
> *From the cookiecutter template we have filled out the ... , ... and ... folder. We have removed the ... folder*
> *because we did not use any ... in our project. We have added an ... folder that contains ... for running our*
> *experiments.*
>
> Answer:

The project was initialized using the official cookiecutter template provided in the course, which defined the overall structure of the repository.
We retained the core layout, including the `src/` directory for source code, `tests/` for automated testing, `configs/` for configuration files, and
`data/` for raw and processed datasets.

The main project logic was implemented inside the `src/credit)card_fraud_analysis` package, including data handlign, model definition, training,
evaluation, and an API for inference. The `tests/` directory was extended with unit, integration, and performance tests to validate components
of the pipeline.

We also added a `dockerfiles/` directory containing seperate Dockerfiles for training, inference, and the API, as well as a Cloud Build configuration
for automated training. A `reports/` directory was included for the exam report, and `docs/` was exneted with project documentation and profilling
notes.

Overall, the cookiecuter structure was preservec, while additional fodlers and files were introduced to support deployment, monitoring, and
reproducability requirements.

### Question 6

> **Did you implement any rules for code quality and format? What about typing and documentation? Additionally,**
> **explain with your own words why these concepts matters in larger projects.**
>
> Recommended answer length: 100-200 words.
>
> Example:
> *We used ... for linting and ... for formatting. We also used ... for typing and ... for documentation. These*
> *concepts are important in larger projects because ... . For example, typing ...*
>
> Answer:

We implemented explixit rules for code quality and formatting to ensure consistency and maintainability throught the project. Code style and linting were
enforced using **Ruff**, which was configured in `pyproject.toml` and integrated both as a **pre-commit hook** and as part of our **CI workfllows**. This
ensured that common issued such as unused imports, inconsistent formatting, and style violations were automatically detected both locally before commits
and remotely during CI.

Formatting was handled usign `ruff format`, guaranteeing a uniform code style across all contributors without relying on manual enforcements. In addition,
core modules include **docstrings** that describe the purpose of the tests, functions, and training components, improving readability and easing onboarding
for new contributors.

We did not enforce strict static type checking, we focused on practical documentation and automated wuality checks that scale well with project size. These
pracitces are especially important in larger projects, where multiples contributions workd in parallel, as they reduce technical debt, improve code readabilit
, and prevent subtle errors from propagating unnoticed through the codebase.

## Version control

> In the following section we are interested in how version control was used in your project during development to
> corporate and increase the quality of your code.

### Question 7

> **How many tests did you implement and what are they testing in your code?**
>
> Recommended answer length: 50-100 words.
>
> Example:
> *In total we have implemented X tests. Primarily we are testing ... and ... as these the most critical parts of our*
> *application but also ... .*
>
> Answer:

In total, we implemented **11 test files in total**, covering unit, integration, and performance testing. Unit tests validate critical components such as
data loading, model construction, forward passes, training, evaluation, and configuration handling. We also implemented both API unit tests and API
integrations tests, the latter explixitly testing FastAPIA lifespan events, model loading, and error handling for invalid inputs.

Additionally, we included a **performance test suite using Locust** to evaluate request latency and system behaviour under load.

### Question 8

> **What is the total code coverage (in percentage) of your code? If your code had a code coverage of 100% (or close**
> **to), would you still trust it to be error free? Explain you reasoning.**
>
> Recommended answer length: 100-200 words.
>
> Example:
> *The total code coverage of code is X%, which includes all our source code. We are far from 100% coverage of our **
> *code and even if we were then...*
>
> Answer:

The total code coverage of our project is approximately **45%**. This coverage mainly reflects the parts of the system that are most critical for
correctness and stability, including data preprocessing, model inference, API endpoints, configuration loading, and core utility functions.
Several modules with low or zero coverage correspond to training scripts, Lightning training pipelines, dataset creation utilities,
and scalability experiments, which are not executed during normal inference or deployment and are therefore less critical for runtime reliability.

Even if our code had close to 100% coverage, we would not consider it fully error-free. High coverage only indicates that lines of code were executed,
not that all edge cases, failure modes, or logical errors were correctly handled. In particular, integration issues, performance bottlenecks,
numerical instability, and unexpected data distributions can still cause failures despite full coverage. For this reason, code coverage
should be viewed as one quality indicator among others, and it must be complemented by integration tests, monitoring, logging,
and validation on real or adversarial data.

### Question 9

> **Did you workflow include using branches and pull requests? If yes, explain how. If not, explain how branches and**
> **pull request can help improve version control.**
>
> Recommended answer length: 100-200 words.
>
> Example:
> *We made use of both branches and PRs in our project. In our group, each member had an branch that they worked on in*
> *addition to the main branch. To merge code we ...*
>
> Answer:
Yes, our workflow included the use of branches and pull requests. During the project, new features and fixes were developed on separate branches instead
of directly on the main branch. Each branch focused on a specific task, such as adding tests, improving the CI pipeline, profiling performance, adding
Docker support, or updating dependencies.
When a task was completed, the changes were merged into the main branch using pull requests. This allowed us to review the changes run automated tests,
nd make sure the code worked correctly before merging. The Git history shows several merged pull requests from feature branches, which confirms that
this workflow was actively used.
After the pull requests were merged, the feature branches were removed. This helped keep the repository clean and easier to manage.

### Question 10

> **Did you use DVC for managing data in your project? If yes, then how did it improve your project to have version**
> **control of your data. If no, explain a case where it would be beneficial to have version control of your data.**
>
> Recommended answer length: 100-200 words.
>
> Example:
> *We did make use of DVC in the following way: ... . In the end it helped us in ... for controlling ... part of our*
> *pipeline*
>
> Answer:

Yes, we used DVC for managing data in our project. The raw and processed datasets are tracked using DVC instead of Git, while Git only stores small
metadata files such as `data.dvc`. This prevents large data files from bloating the Git repository and keeps version control fast and clean.
We configured a remote DVC storage using Google Cloud Storage (GCS). This allows all team members a remote DVC storage using Google Cloud Storage (GCS).
This allows all team members and CI pipelines to pull pipelines to pull the exact same version of the data when checking out a specific Git commit.
As a result, experiments can be reproduced reliably, since the code version and the corresponding data version are always aligned.
Using DVC also made it easy to detect whether data had changed and whether retraining or re-running experiments was required. This was especially
useful when datasets evolved during development.

### Question 11

> **Discuss you continuous integration setup. What kind of continuous integration are you running (unittesting,**
> **linting, etc.)? Do you test multiple operating systems, Python  version etc. Do you make use of caching? Feel free**
> **to insert a link to one of your GitHub actions workflow.**
>
> Recommended answer length: 200-300 words.
>
> Example:
> *We have organized our continuous integration into 3 separate files: one for doing ..., one for running ... testing*
> *and one for running ... . In particular for our ..., we used ... .An example of a triggered workflow can be seen*
> *here: <weblink>*
>
> Answer:

We use GitHub Actions to implement continuous integration (CI) for our project. The CI pipeline is automatically triggered on every `push` and `pull_request` to the
`main` branch, ensuring that new changes are continuously vaildated before being merged.

Our CI setup covers code quality checks, formatting, and automated testing. In particular, we run static code analysis and import/format consistency checks using Ruff,
followed  by unit and integration tests using Pytest. This ensures that code adheres to a consistent style and that functional beahvior is verified automatically.

To ensure robustness and portability, our CI workflow runs across mutliple operating systems (`ubuntu-latest`, `windows-latest`, and `macos-latest`) and multiple
Python versions (Python 3.11 and 3.12) using a matrix strategy. This helps detect OS- or versio-specific issues early and improves reproducability across environments.

We also make use of dependency caching by `actions/setup-python`, caching pip dependencies based on `requirements.txt` and `requirements_dev.txt`. This significantly
reduces CI excecution time by avoiding dependency installations across runs.

## Running code and tracking experiments

> In the following section we are interested in learning more about the experimental setup for running your code and
> especially the reproducibility of your experiments.

### Question 12

> **How did you configure experiments? Did you make use of config files? Explain with coding examples of how you would**
> **run a experiment.**
>
> Recommended answer length: 50-100 words.
>
> Example:
> *We used a simple argparser, that worked in the following way: Python  my_script.py --lr 1e-3 --batch_size 25*
>
> Answer:

**Hydra** was used for experiment configuration combined with a `config.yaml`, which centralizes all hyperparameters regarding model architecture, training and evaluation procedures, wandb logging. This approach eliminates hardcoded values and ensures reproducibility. 
To run an experiment with the default settings:
```bash
python src/credit_card_fraud_analysis/train_lightning.
```
It also possible to dynamically execute an experiment by overriding arguments (for example changing the learning rate, batch size, device)
```bash
python src/credit_card_fraud_analysis/train_lightning.py training.lr=0.005 training.batch_size=512 device="cuda"
```


### Question 13

> **Reproducibility of experiments are important. Related to the last question, how did you secure that no information**
> **is lost when running experiments and that your experiments are reproducible?**
>
> Recommended answer length: 100-200 words.
>
> Example:
> *We made use of config files. Whenever an experiment is run the following happens: ... . To reproduce an experiment*
> *one would have to do ...*
>
> Answer:

For ensuring full reproducibility and preventing information loss, configuration and logging tools have been utilized such as **Hydra, Logging (Loguru), PyTorch Lightning, and Weights & Biases (W&B)**.
- Centralized Configuration:  All hyperparameters, from seeds to architecture dimensions, are stored in `config.yaml`. A hydra config loader (`hydra_config_loader.py`) was implemented for locating the configuration and initializing Hydra
- Consistent results: Specified seed in `torch.manual_seed` and configure the Lightning Trainer with `deterministic: true`
- Automated Experiment Tracking: We use WandbLogger to automatically log metrics, model checkpoints, and the system configuration to the WANDB cloud. Additionally, the trainer uses a `profiler="simple"` to log performance bottlenecks, ensuring the experiment's execution environment is well-documented. In addition, a custom loguru logger has been implemented for logging purposes.
- Model Versioning: Model checkpoint are used for monitoring the train_loss metric and saving the model state. Also, optimization code is being executed using **ONNX** (dynamic axes for varying batch sizes, optimizing the computational graph of the model) and forecasting and sharing machine learning models.


### Question 14

> **Upload 1 to 3 screenshots that show the experiments that you have done in W&B (or another experiment tracking**
> **service of your choice). This may include loss graphs, logged images, hyperparameter sweeps etc. You can take**
> **inspiration from [this figure](figures/wandb.png). Explain what metrics you are tracking and why they are**
> **important.**
>
> Recommended answer length: 200-300 words + 1 to 3 screenshots.
>
> Example:
> *As seen in the first image when have tracked ... and ... which both inform us about ... in our experiments.*
> *As seen in the second image we are also tracking ... and ...*
>
> Answer:

To ensure the success and reproducibility of our experiments, we have integrated **Weights & Biases (W&B)** for real-time tracking and visualization. As seen in the **Charts** image ![my_image](figures/wb_charts.png), we track the following metrics:
- train_loss_step and train_loss_epoch: These plots display the Mean Squared Error (MSE) reconstruction loss decreasing over time. Because an autoencoder is trained to reconstruct normal transactions, a consistently declining loss(ending at 0.0686 in our run) indicates the model is successfully capturing the latent structure of the data
- lr-Adam: Learning rate it remains stable at **0.001** as configured in our config.yaml. This ensures that the optimizer is behaving as expected and that no unexpected scheduling issues occurred during the run
- epoch: This verifies the training progression through all 30 planned epochs, providing a timeline for performance improvements
As seen in the **Overview** ![my_image](figures/wb_overview.png), we secure reproducibility by capturing the exact environment:
- Configuration Parameters: W&B automatically snapshots the config.yaml hyperparameters, such as `hidden_dim: 32, dropout: 0.1, and weight_decay: 1e-5`
- Git State: The system logs the specific Git commit hash and branch, ensuring we can link results to a exact version of the code
- System Hardware: It records hardware details, such as the logical **CPU count (16)**, which is essential for diagnosing the data-loading bottlenecks identified in our profiler report

> Example:
> *We did manage to write an API for our model. We used FastAPI to do this. We did this by ... . We also added ...*

>
> Answer:

The project successfully implemented and deployed a high-performance FastAPI service for credit card fraud detection. The system is designed to handle inference using both PyTorch and optimized ONNX backends. The api.py file uses an asynchronous lifespan manager to handle resource initialization. Upon startup, it automatically scans the /models directory for the most recent PyTorch checkpoints (.ckpt) and ONNX files. It prioritizes loading an optimized ONNX model for low-latency inference. 

The API exposes four primary endpoints:
- `/predict`: The standard fraud detection endpoint that calculates reconstruction error for predicting if a transaction is fraudulent or not
- `/predict_optimized`: optimized predictions using a quantized 8-bit ONNX model, which reduces latency and memory usage
- `/monitoring`: Generates a JSON data drift report by comparing live request data against the training reference data
- `/`: verify the service status

### Question 24

> **Did you manage to deploy your API, either in locally or cloud? If not, describe why. If yes, describe how and**

>
> Answer:

For development and local testing, the service is served using **Uvicorn**: ```bash python -m uvicorn src.credit_card_fraud_analysis.api:app --reload```This environment includes a integrated Prometheus metrics registry at `/metrics` to track request latency and error rates
For deploying the application in cloud as **Google Run Cloud** function a Dockerfile was created to package application code, dependencies (**onnxruntime and torch**), and the exported model files. A Docker image was built and pushed to `europe-west1-docker.pkg.dev` artifact registry and then instructions were provided for **Google Cloud Platform (GCP)** to take the containerized API and run it as a web service
The deployment was done using the following command
```bash gcloud run deploy gcp-test-service --image europe-west1-docker.pkg.dev/mlops-group27/mlops-docker/gcp_test_app:latest --platform managed --region europe-west1 --allow-unauthenticated```

>
> Example:
> *For unit testing we used ... and for load testing we used ... . The results of the load testing showed that ...*
> *before the service crashed.*
>
> Answer:

Unit testing, integration testing and performance load testing was implemented to ensure the reliability and scalability of the API
- For unit testing, **Pytest** was utilized to validate individual components  and test credit card fraud detection system. They validate Hydra configurations for type safety, ensure data preprocessing correctly handles SMOTE and tensor shapes, and verify the Autoencoder architecture via forward passes and weight updates. The suite also includes tests for model imports, anomaly detection thresholding logic and weights update correctly during training
- For performance load testing, **Locust** was employed to simulate concurrent users interacting with the API. A custom predict_fraud class generated realistic requests with random feature values, targeting the `/predict` endpoint with high frequency. This allowed the developer to monitor response times, throughput, and failure rates. This allowed to observe response times, throughput, and failure rates
- Integration testing focuses on the API application using **FastAPI’s TestClient and Pytest**. These tests simulate real HTTP requests to the `/predict` endpoint, triggering startup events like model loading. The suite verifies successful fraud detection predictions, ensures the system handles feature dimension mismatches with 400 errors, and validates that malformed inputs trigger appropriate 422 validation errors

> Answer:

A monitoring system for the credit card fraud detection application was implemented based on three key components: real-time metrics, data drift analysis, and background logging. Monitoring improves the longevity of the application by enabling early detection of performance and operational issues, allowing model retraining or code optimization before failures impact users.
**Monitoring Implementation**
- Real-time Performance Metrics: The application utilizes Prometheus to monitors request counts, prediction latencies using Histograms observe response-time distributions, and input feature complexity through Summaries. The total number of prediction requests are recorded to monitor traffic and usage patterns, as well as the number of prediction errors to quickly identify failures or unstable behavior.  These metrics are exposed via a `/metrics` endpoint
- Data Drift Monitoring: A dedicated `/monitoring` endpoint generates drift reports by comparing incoming production data against a saved reference_data.csv. This allows the system to detect shifts in data distributions that might degrade model accuracy over time. By generating a drift report on demand, we can identify shifts in feature distributions that may degrade model performance over time. In addition, background tasks are used to asynchronously log input features, reconstruction errors, and prediction outcomes to a database file without affecting API latency

> Answer:

During the project development, our 4-member team (Group 27) utilized several GCP services for the MLOps pipeline. While specific credit amounts weren't tracked individually per member, the team collectively used approximately 50-100 credits throughout the project development phase.

The most expensive service was likely Cloud Build due to frequent Docker image builds for the training pipeline and API deployment, followed by Artifact Registry for storing multiple Docker images (training, API, and frontend containers). Google Cloud Storage for DVC remote storage was relatively inexpensive, consuming minimal storage costs for the credit card fraud dataset.

Working in the cloud provided significant benefits including seamless collaboration through shared storage, automated CI/CD pipelines, and scalable deployment options via Cloud Run. However, the learning curve for GCP services and managing costs required careful monitoring. The cloud infrastructure enabled us to implement a complete MLOps workflow with version control, automated training, and production deployment that wouldn't have been feasible with local resources alone.

> Answer:

We implemented several extra features in our project beyond the standard requirements:

Streamlit Frontend: We created a comprehensive web interface using Streamlit that provides an interactive user experience for credit card fraud detection. The frontend includes multiple input methods (manual entry, sample transactions, CSV upload), real-time fraud predictions with visual risk indicators, and detailed error analysis with charts. We implemented this to make the model accessible to non-technical users and demonstrate the practical application.

Data Drift Detection Service: We implemented a monitoring system using the Evidently library that tracks data drift between reference and current data. The API exposes a /monitoring endpoint that generates drift reports in JSON format, allowing real-time monitoring of model performance degradation.

Comprehensive Prometheus Metrics: Beyond basic API monitoring, we instrumented our FastAPI application with detailed metrics including request counters, latency histograms, error counters, and feature summary statistics. The metrics are exposed via a /metrics endpoint for integration with monitoring systems.

Model Optimization Pipeline: We implemented model pruning and ONNX optimization (scalable.py) with dynamic quantization to improve inference performance, reducing model size while maintaining accuracy.

These features enhance the production-readiness and user experience of our MLOps pipeline.

>
> Answer:

The starting point of our [MLOps architecture](figures/q29.png) is our local development setup, where we integrated PyTorch Lightning for model development, Hydra for configuration management, Weights & Biases for experiment tracking, and DVC for data version control. Our development environment includes comprehensive testing suites, Docker containers for reproducible deployments, and pre-commit hooks for code quality.

Whenever we commit code and push to GitHub, it automatically triggers multiple CI/CD workflows through GitHub Actions. These include unit testing across multiple operating systems (Ubuntu, Windows, macOS) and Python versions (3.11, 3.12), code linting with Ruff, Docker image building, and specialized workflows for data and model changes. The data change workflow uses DVC to validate data integrity and generates automated reports using CML.

From GitHub, our pipeline integrates with Google Cloud Platform services. We use Cloud Storage as the remote backend for DVC to store our credit card fraud dataset. Cloud Build automatically builds and pushes Docker images to the Artifact Registry whenever code changes are detected. We maintain separate containers for training (train.dockerfile), API inference (api.dockerfile), and the Streamlit frontend (frontend.dockerfile).

The deployment phase utilizes Cloud Run to host both our FastAPI backend and Streamlit frontend as serverless containers. The backend provides fraud prediction endpoints with Prometheus monitoring, data drift detection using Evidently, and ONNX optimization for improved inference performance. The frontend offers an intuitive web interface for users to input transaction data and receive fraud predictions with detailed visualizations.

Users access the system through their web browsers, where they can analyze transactions using multiple input methods (manual entry, CSV upload, or sample data). The architecture supports real-time predictions, model monitoring, and automatic scaling based on demand. The entire pipeline ensures reproducibility, continuous integration, and seamless deployment from development to production.

>
> Answer:

The biggest challenges in our project revolved around environment consistency and deployment complexity. With a team of 4 members working across different operating systems, we spent considerable time ensuring that the same code worked reliably on Windows, macOS, and Linux. The path handling differences became particularly problematic when setting up the PYTHONPATH for imports, which led us to create platform-specific launch scripts (start_system.bat) and implement cross-platform compatibility in our tasks.py using the WINDOWS = os.name == "nt" flag.

Docker configuration presented another significant hurdle. We struggled with getting the correct module paths working inside containers, especially for the API deployment. The initial api.dockerfile had incorrect import paths (src.api.main:app instead of src.credit_card_fraud_analysis.api:app), which caused numerous failed deployments. We overcame this by implementing comprehensive integration tests and adding proper error handling to catch these issues early.

Google Cloud Platform integration consumed substantial development time. Setting up DVC with GCS storage, configuring service accounts for Cloud Build, and managing artifact registry permissions were more complex than anticipated. The authentication between local development, GitHub Actions, and GCP services required careful coordination of secrets management and IAM roles.

CI/CD pipeline complexity grew beyond our initial expectations. Implementing matrix testing across multiple OS and Python versions, while maintaining reasonable execution times required extensive caching strategies and workflow optimization. We had to balance thorough testing with CI cost considerations.

The frontend-backend communication also presented challenges, particularly with environment variable management and service discovery. We solved this by implementing robust error handling and creating fallback mechanisms for backend URL resolution.

To overcome these challenges, we adopted a systematic debugging approach using comprehensive logging, extensive unit and integration testing, and incremental deployment strategies. The implementation of dev containers significantly improved development environment consistency and reduced setup friction for team members.

> Answer:

All four team members - s242973 (Dionysios Sellinas), s253542 (Christos Psallidas), s253560 (Dimitrios Dimitriou), and s242831 (Georgios Fragkiadoulakis) - contributed equally to the project development. The team collaboratively worked on all major components including the initial cookiecutter project setup, cloud infrastructure configuration with GCP and DVC, PyTorch Lightning model development for credit card fraud detection, comprehensive CI/CD pipeline implementation with GitHub Actions, Docker containerization for training/API/frontend services, FastAPI backend development with Prometheus monitoring, Streamlit frontend creation, extensive testing strategies (unit, integration, and performance), cross-platform compatibility ensuring support for Windows/macOS/Linux, data version control setup, deployment automation, and comprehensive documentation. Each member participated in code reviews, debugging sessions, and quality assurance processes while maintaining consistent coding standards through pre-commit hooks and Ruff formatting.

We extensively used GitHub Copilot for code completion and boilerplate generation, particularly helpful for writing comprehensive test suites and Docker configurations. ChatGPT was utilized for debugging complex configuration issues, especially with GCP authentication, CI/CD pipeline troubleshooting, and resolving environment-specific compatibility problems. We also used AI tools for optimizing our monitoring and logging implementations, and for generating comprehensive docstrings and code documentation.
