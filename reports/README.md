# Exam template for 02476 Machine Learning Operations

This is the report template for the exam. Please only remove the text formatted as with three dashes in front and behind
like:

```--- question 1 fill here ---```

Where you instead should add your answers. Any other changes may have unwanted consequences when your report is
auto-generated at the end of the course. For questions where you are asked to include images, start by adding the image
to the `figures` subfolder (please only use `.png`, `.jpg` or `.jpeg`) and then add the following code in your answer:

`![my_image](figures/<image>.<extension>)`

In addition to this markdown file, we also provide the `report.py` script that provides two utility functions:

Running:

```bash
python report.py html
```

Will generate a `.html` page of your report. After the deadline for answering this template, we will auto-scrape
everything in this `reports` folder and then use this utility to generate a `.html` page that will be your serve
as your final hand-in.

Running

```bash
python report.py check
```

Will check your answers in this template against the constraints listed for each question e.g. is your answer too
short, too long, or have you included an image when asked. For both functions to work you mustn't rename anything.
The script has two dependencies that can be installed with

```bash
pip install typer markdown
```

or

```bash
uv add typer markdown
```

## Overall project checklist

The checklist is *exhaustive* which means that it includes everything that you could do on the project included in the
curriculum in this course. Therefore, we do not expect at all that you have checked all boxes at the end of the project.

> **which did you use and how did they help you complete the project?**
>
> Recommended answer length: 0-200 words.
>
> Example:
> *We used the third-party framework ... in our project. We used functionality ... and functionality ... from the*
> *package to do ... and ... in our project*.
>
> Answer:

We used **EvidentlyAI** to perform data drift detection by comparing reference data collected during training with data observed at inference time.

For configuration management, we used **Hydra**, which simplified experiment configuration and enabled clean seperation between code and hyperparametrs.

We also used **Typer** to implement command-line interfaces for training and evaluation scripts, providing a consistent and user-freindly way to run
project components.

Finnaly, we used **Weights & Bias** for experiment tracking, enabling logging of training metrics, configuration parameters, and model artifacts, which
supported systematic experimentation and comparison across runs.

## Coding environment

> In the following section we are interested in learning more about you local development environment. This includes
> how you managed dependencies, the structure of your code and how you managed code quality.

### Question 4

> **Explain how you managed dependencies in your project? Explain the process a new team member would have to go**
> **through to get an exact copy of your environment.**
>
> Recommended answer length: 100-200 words
>
> Example:
> *We used ... for managing our dependencies. The list of dependencies was auto-generated using ... . To get a*
> *complete copy of our development environment, one would have to run the following commands*
>
> Answer:

We managed project dependencies using a combination of `pyproject.toml` and the `uv` package manager, which allowed us to maintain a reproducible
and well-defined Python environment. All direct dependencies are declared in `pyproject.toml`, while exact, resolved versions are pinned in the
automatically generated `uv.lock` file.

For local development, a new team memmber ca recreate the environment by first installing `uv` and then running `uv sync`, which installs all
dependencies exaclty as specified in the lock file. Development-specific dependecies, such as testing and linitng tools, are included in a seperate
dependency group to keep the runtime environment minimal.

Dependencies are als reprorudef in containerized environments. The Dockerfiles used for training and inference install dependencies directly from the
same dependency specifications, ensuring consistency between local development, continuous integration, and deployment.

### Question 5

> **We expect that you initialized your project using the cookiecutter template. Explain the overall structure of your**
> **code. What did you fill out? Did you deviate from the template in some way?**
>
> Recommended answer length: 100-200 words
>
> Example:
> *From the cookiecutter template we have filled out the ... , ... and ... folder. We have removed the ... folder*
> *because we did not use any ... in our project. We have added an ... folder that contains ... for running our*
> *experiments.*
>
> Answer:

The project was initialized using the official cookiecutter template provided in the course, which defined the overall structure of the repository.
We retained the core layout, including the `src/` directory for source code, `tests/` for automated testing, `configs/` for configuration files, and
`data/` for raw and processed datasets.

The main project logic was implemented inside the `src/credit)card_fraud_analysis` package, including data handlign, model definition, training,
evaluation, and an API for inference. The `tests/` directory was extended with unit, integration, and performance tests to validate components
of the pipeline.

We also added a `dockerfiles/` directory containing seperate Dockerfiles for training, inference, and the API, as well as a Cloud Build configuration
for automated training. A `reports/` directory was included for the exam report, and `docs/` was exneted with project documentation and profilling
notes.

Overall, the cookiecuter structure was preservec, while additional fodlers and files were introduced to support deployment, monitoring, and
reproducability requirements.

### Question 6

> **Did you implement any rules for code quality and format? What about typing and documentation? Additionally,**
> **explain with your own words why these concepts matters in larger projects.**
>
> Recommended answer length: 100-200 words.
>
> Example:
> *We used ... for linting and ... for formatting. We also used ... for typing and ... for documentation. These*
> *concepts are important in larger projects because ... . For example, typing ...*
>
> Answer:

We implemented explixit rules for code quality and formatting to ensure consistency and maintainability throught the project. Code style and linting were
enforced using **Ruff**, which was configured in `pyproject.toml` and integrated both as a **pre-commit hook** and as part of our **CI workfllows**. This
ensured that common issued such as unused imports, inconsistent formatting, and style violations were automatically detected both locally before commits
and remotely during CI.

Formatting was handled usign `ruff format`, guaranteeing a uniform code style across all contributors without relying on manual enforcements. In addition,
core modules include **docstrings** that describe the purpose of the tests, functions, and training components, improving readability and easing onboarding
for new contributors.

We did not enforce strict static type checking, we focused on practical documentation and automated wuality checks that scale well with project size. These
pracitces are especially important in larger projects, where multiples contributions workd in parallel, as they reduce technical debt, improve code readabilit
, and prevent subtle errors from propagating unnoticed through the codebase.

## Version control

> In the following section we are interested in how version control was used in your project during development to
> corporate and increase the quality of your code.

### Question 7

> **How many tests did you implement and what are they testing in your code?**
>
> Recommended answer length: 50-100 words.
>
> Example:
> *In total we have implemented X tests. Primarily we are testing ... and ... as these the most critical parts of our*
> *application but also ... .*
>
> Answer:

In total, we implemented **11 test files in total**, covering unit, integration, and performance testing. Unit tests validate critical components such as
data loading, model construction, forward passes, training, evaluation, and configuration handling. We also implemented both API unit tests and API
integrations tests, the latter explixitly testing FastAPIA lifespan events, model loading, and error handling for invalid inputs.

Additionally, we included a **performance test suite using Locust** to evaluate request latency and system behaviour under load.

### Question 8

> **What is the total code coverage (in percentage) of your code? If your code had a code coverage of 100% (or close**
> **to), would you still trust it to be error free? Explain you reasoning.**
>
> Recommended answer length: 100-200 words.
>
> Example:
> *The total code coverage of code is X%, which includes all our source code. We are far from 100% coverage of our **
> *code and even if we were then...*
>
> Answer:

The total code coverage of our project is approximately **45%**. This coverage mainly reflects the parts of the system that are most critical for
correctness and stability, including data preprocessing, model inference, API endpoints, configuration loading, and core utility functions.
Several modules with low or zero coverage correspond to training scripts, Lightning training pipelines, dataset creation utilities,
and scalability experiments, which are not executed during normal inference or deployment and are therefore less critical for runtime reliability.

Even if our code had close to 100% coverage, we would not consider it fully error-free. High coverage only indicates that lines of code were executed,
not that all edge cases, failure modes, or logical errors were correctly handled. In particular, integration issues, performance bottlenecks,
numerical instability, and unexpected data distributions can still cause failures despite full coverage. For this reason, code coverage
should be viewed as one quality indicator among others, and it must be complemented by integration tests, monitoring, logging,
and validation on real or adversarial data.

### Question 9

> **Did you workflow include using branches and pull requests? If yes, explain how. If not, explain how branches and**
> **pull request can help improve version control.**
>
> Recommended answer length: 100-200 words.
>
> Example:
> *We made use of both branches and PRs in our project. In our group, each member had an branch that they worked on in*
> *addition to the main branch. To merge code we ...*
>
> Answer:
Yes, our workflow included the use of branches and pull requests. During the project, new features and fixes were developed on separate branches instead
of directly on the main branch. Each branch focused on a specific task, such as adding tests, improving the CI pipeline, profiling performance, adding
Docker support, or updating dependencies.
When a task was completed, the changes were merged into the main branch using pull requests. This allowed us to review the changes run automated tests,
nd make sure the code worked correctly before merging. The Git history shows several merged pull requests from feature branches, which confirms that
this workflow was actively used.
After the pull requests were merged, the feature branches were removed. This helped keep the repository clean and easier to manage.

### Question 10

> **Did you use DVC for managing data in your project? If yes, then how did it improve your project to have version**
> **control of your data. If no, explain a case where it would be beneficial to have version control of your data.**
>
> Recommended answer length: 100-200 words.
>
> Example:
> *We did make use of DVC in the following way: ... . In the end it helped us in ... for controlling ... part of our*
> *pipeline*
>
> Answer:

Yes, we used DVC for managing data in our project. The raw and processed datasets are tracked using DVC instead of Git, while Git only stores small
metadata files such as `data.dvc`. This prevents large data files from bloating the Git repository and keeps version control fast and clean.
We configured a remote DVC storage using Google Cloud Storage (GCS). This allows all team members a remote DVC storage using Google Cloud Storage (GCS).
This allows all team members and CI pipelines to pull pipelines to pull the exact same version of the data when checking out a specific Git commit.
As a result, experiments can be reproduced reliably, since the code version and the corresponding data version are always aligned.
Using DVC also made it easy to detect whether data had changed and whether retraining or re-running experiments was required. This was especially
useful when datasets evolved during development.

### Question 11

> **Discuss you continuous integration setup. What kind of continuous integration are you running (unittesting,**
> **linting, etc.)? Do you test multiple operating systems, Python  version etc. Do you make use of caching? Feel free**
> **to insert a link to one of your GitHub actions workflow.**
>
> Recommended answer length: 200-300 words.
>
> Example:
> *We have organized our continuous integration into 3 separate files: one for doing ..., one for running ... testing*
> *and one for running ... . In particular for our ..., we used ... .An example of a triggered workflow can be seen*
> *here: <weblink>*
>
> Answer:

We use GitHub Actions to implement continuous integration (CI) for our project. The CI pipeline is automatically triggered on every `push` and `pull_request` to the
`main` branch, ensuring that new changes are continuously vaildated before being merged.

Our CI setup covers code quality checks, formatting, and automated testing. In particular, we run static code analysis and import/format consistency checks using Ruff,
followed  by unit and integration tests using Pytest. This ensures that code adheres to a consistent style and that functional beahvior is verified automatically.

To ensure robustness and portability, our CI workflow runs across mutliple operating systems (`ubuntu-latest`, `windows-latest`, and `macos-latest`) and multiple
Python versions (Python 3.11 and 3.12) using a matrix strategy. This helps detect OS- or versio-specific issues early and improves reproducability across environments.

We also make use of dependency caching by `actions/setup-python`, caching pip dependencies based on `requirements.txt` and `requirements_dev.txt`. This significantly
reduces CI excecution time by avoiding dependency installations across runs.
